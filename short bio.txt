I have pursued my Bs.C. in Computer Science and Engineering from the passion of exploring this field. With the aim I have the focus to engage in research 
in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. My undergraduate capstone and thesis project is based on a combined application of Computer Vision and
Data Mining techniques to detect the analysis of road condition of Bangladesh. I have worked as Research Assistant from 2017-2019 in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
in a project of Online Sewage Treament Plant Monitoring. I worked as a Web and Back-end developer and 
applied data mining techniques on the acquired data. After that I have joined in a research project funded by the Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh under the 
supervision of Department of Environmental Science Management of North South University for the Coastal Climatic Data Collection and Management.
I worked as a full-stack application developer and for application of machine learning techniques on the acquried data. I have been appointed as 
an undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of North South University for the courses of
"Data Structure and Algorithms", "Java Programming Language" and "Design and Analysis of Algorithms". I had also the opportunity to do internship
in the start up Doctorbaari.com as a Front-end Developer.
